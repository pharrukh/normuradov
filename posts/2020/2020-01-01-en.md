Had a guest last night some years younger than me.<br>
He is keen on networking, puts it as a cornerstone of success.<br>
He also believes that talent is a thing that outstanding abilities come by default to only selected ones.<br>
He is a so-far-successful youngster doing his masters in economics and finance, scholarship winner.<br>

I do not like the idea of being predisposed with anything.<br>
I want to believe that hard work that transfers into a smart work brings outstanding results.<br>
It was Dr. Ericsson in his popular work "Peak" who shed some light on these concepts.<br>
It was Dr. Dweck in her popular work "Mindset: The new psychology of success" who stressed that attitude brings tremendous progress.<br>
It was Dr. Newport in his numerous works who sparkled fire in souls with the idea of working effectively towards one's goals.<br>
It was Dr. Seelig who showed that by applying creativity you can morph your personality and grow.<br>
It was her colleague, Dr. Roth in my favorite "Achievement Habit" that did not leave place for talent.
