<h2>idea</h2>

I have this idea since maybe 2-3 months that even the best experts cannot predict what will happen next in life - it is so unpredictable. The longer one goes into the future, the less certain it is. We can treat is like insecurity, but I fund it charming. So you have your life and you own it and not even the smartest person not even the most sophisticated algorithm not now, not even in 100 years will be able to consider the infinity of variables that are defining our reality...
