<h2>idea</h2>

I started reading [The Power of Ritual](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-power-of-ritual-casper-ter-kuile?variant=32894732140578) by Casper ter Kuile. <br>
I was expecting it to be more pop. <br>
That person is a bold one. <br>
He went to [Harvard Divinity School](https://hds.harvard.edu/#). <br>
There were at least three ideas so far. <br>
First, communities are crucial for people to fulfil the deep need that people have. <br>
Second, one can read a text close to them, most probably in a native language, in a way that makes them reconnect with themselves. <br>
This person managed to build a successful podcast to prove the point. <br>
He started to read [Harry Potter](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/about/our-story) in a way that helped people find deeper meaning. <br>
They called it sacred reading. <br>
I have yet to try it. <br>
It is hard for me to think of a work that can fit the purpose <br>
Reading was also more of an intimate process for me. <br>
The last idea that I touched on was a sabbath. <br>
The same idea is mentioned by many people. <br>
Although it has its roots in religion - but what does not - it can be applied to daily life. <br>
I tried it a couple of times but failed. <br>
I failed to persuade my whole family to follow. <br>

<h2>blogging</h2>

<h3>metrics</h3>

I got +80 subscribers, true. <br>
I was again due to shares. <br>
It is also due to the first real post that I have made - a [book review](https://www.normuradov.com/posts/2023/red-boar-book-review-en/). <br>
As you see, the second spike below was mostly attributed to the multiple shares of my two posts <br>

As you see here, most of my readers are from Uzbekistan. <br>
Yes, I want to bring value to people from my motherland. <br>

<h2>skills and knowledge</h2>

I solved only one problem last contest. <br>
So my rating went down. <br>
That was the contest when I felt close to solving the hard problem. <br>
The second, the medium one, I even needed to figure out how to solve. <br>
And again, I got a problem with bitwise operations that I failed to solve. <br>

Finally, for more than 70 days, I have been solving problems without a break, and finally, my max steak started to grow. <br>
Only a little important but motivating. <br>

<h2>body and soul</h2>

This week I had a chance to walk more during the day. <br>
As the days get longer, the evening walks will again be enjoyed. <br>
One of my friends made a ritual out of it. <br>
He truly followed all the three steps that Casper shows in his book: <br>
(attention) he gives his complete attention to the walk <br>
(intention) he walks when he decides <br>
(repetition) he does it daily <br>
Although he sometimes does crazy things, I consider him one of the wisest people. <br>
It always feels like he lived more than one life. <br>
