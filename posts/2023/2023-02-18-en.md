<h2>idea</h2>

What is important for you in your work? <br>
Is it a great product or mission? <br>
Are that people whom you work with? <br>
Is it the deep sense of self-realization that your skills help you bring to the table? <br>

<h2>words</h2>

This week I learned the term [_algorithmic prison_](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/welcome-to-algorithmic-prison/283985/) from [Dr. Kleppmann](https://martin.kleppmann.com/) in _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_. <br>
As developers, we have huge power over the lives of people. <br>
We can deny it or not feel it because of our poor skills in some areas. <br>
Still, we should not have an illusion about every commit and pull request's effect on the users. <br>
If more decisions are made because of the growing complexity of the systems we build, we should ensure the people are not suffering as an outcome. <br>
Does it mean more work, more design, and more caution? <br>
There is a lot I have already learned in that regard that learned in my current team. <br>
German culture encourages that way of development. <br>
That may explain why Dr Kleppmann, a German himself, mentioned it. <br>

<h2>blogging</h2>

<h3>metrics</h3>

This week there was a huge jump in blog visitors. <br>
That was thanks to Jahongir.<br>
He shared my latest post on [his Telegram channel](https://t.me/JR_TwitGram) with 3k+ subscribers.<br>
In Telegram, I got 62 new subscribers.<br>

The stats from Telegram surprised me. <br>
They provide much more than I expected: <br>

- number of views
- number of shares
- the language of viewers

<h2>skills and knowledge</h2>

This week I continued with a sliding window. <br>
I lost focus because of work. <br>
I wanted to concentrate on one growing in complexity task. <br>
So I ended up just following the daily recommendation by the LeetCode. <br>
Today I have a new contest. <br>
Let's see how it goes. <br>

<h2>body and soul</h2>

What does decrease the stress level for you? <br>
[Dr. Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/) in a popular self-help book on attention management _Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World_ mentioned walking in green areas as an effective way to decrease stress. <br>
In a cloudy Berlin, I am more surprised to see empty parks at whatever time of the year or day. <br>
Still, this approach works wonders for me. <br>
Within 30 mins to 1 hour, I usually get back to a deeper touch with reality. <br>
I move out of my thoughts to my feelings, to reality. <br>
