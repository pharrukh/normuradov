<h2>idea</h2>

I quit my job. The decision was tough. Now I want to apply for a few Master's programs in Germany. I will sit the IELTS exam on the 15th of April. I will focus on NLP for the next weeks and months. I have been postponing this, and the moment has come. I will prepare my first educational video in the coming week.

<h2>blogging</h2>

I decided to start producing video content. One informal about me in Russian in the TikTok/shorts/reels genre. So far, I have done it in the [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@farrukh.normuradov?lang=en
) only. One formal professional dedicated to the area where I want to build expertise - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0_9xxhC5rCNK31RG32Dl8A). This area is NLP / Text Analysis for the Russian language. This niche looks vacant to me. My mentee, Akbar, was surprised by my choice of writing about NLP for the Russian language in English. I see the need for tools and better services for the West to understand this language better.

<h3>metrics</h3>

I was off for over 2 weeks, so only a few people visited my blog. No wonder. Consistency is what attracts my community.

Here the number of my community members has just slightly decreased. The surprising twist was when 3 people unsubscribed after I shared the link to TikTok.

<h2>skills and knowledge</h2>

With LeetCode, the status is demotivating. Not only did I not solve problems, but I also participated in a contest yesterday and solved 0 problems. But such is a life full of ups and downs. This is not the last downturn, and I know I will shine even brighter in this area soon.

<h2>body and soul</h2>

Mental health. How much do we care about it? How much does stress affects us? What stresses us? Do we understand it? I seriously underestimated how much my expectations from people influenced me. I learned that I seek deeper relationships while most people - at least in my circle - prefer superficial / "professional" ones.
