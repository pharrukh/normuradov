<h2>idea</h2>

This week I stood before the statue to Carl Linnaeus. Grandiose. Inspiring.

I may have read about him in a book on Darwin, or I may have heard it told by my grandfather. Classifying animals and plants was a step forward in understanding how life came about.

My thoughts were on the value of this monument. Does it benefit Professor Linnaeus in any way? Who is the beneficiary if not him? The people? What is the memory of a nation? In what way does the memory of an outstanding person contribute to the nation? For a person who shares an identity with Professor Linnaeus, does it uplift the spirit?
