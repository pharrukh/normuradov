### Weekly (2) 2018-06-15-2018-06-21

This week was tough. I was more committed to the PC->RS integration.

The goal is still to prepare a tech-talk for July 12 on Serverless in Kubernetes to illustrate (a) the scalability of functions and (b) the new way of solving existing.

I did the following:
1. walked through intro to K8s - http://rahmonov.me/posts/introduction-to-kubernetes/
2. setup rest api endpoint with https://serverless.com/

I will try your approach of taking time to prepare in the office next week: 30 mins at the end of the day.

Updated plan / time allocation:

1. 7-14 June: 
    1. docker intro
    2. docker: nodejs + mongoldb
2. 15-21 June:
    1. intro to K8s - http://rahmonov.me/posts/introduction-to-kubernetes/
    2. setup rest api endpoint with https://serverless.com/
3. 22-28 June - first draft of the presentation:
    1. complete nodejs + mongoldb in K8s
    2. hello world in serverless framework:
        1. https://serverless.com/
        2. https://kubeless.io/
        3. https://fission.io/
        4. https://nuclio.io/
    3. setup REST api in nodejs that is reading from 2 collections
    4. populate collection with mock data
    5. implement REST api with functions
    6. write a command line client that heavily loads both REST api-s and measures the time
    7. deploy to Azure
    8. prepare the slides
    9. rewrite solution in Java
4. 29 June - 5 July - second draft (be ready by the end of that week):
    1. prepare the code for both endpoints in repository
    2. automate the api load
    3. prepare the slides
5. 6-11 July - 1-2 rehearsals
