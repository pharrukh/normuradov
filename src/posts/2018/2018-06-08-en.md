### Weekly (1) 2018-06-08-2018-06-14

It is a week that I asked you to be my mentor. This message is a weekly update.

Current goal is to prepare a tech-talk for July 12 on Serverless in Kubernetes to illustrate (a) the scalability of functions and (b) the new way of solving existing.

You essentially suggested three things to me:
1. a method: do something fast dirty and try to reflect afterward to understand how I learn;
2. a strategy to prepare for the tech talk: put aside 30 mins daily at the end of working day;
3. think out the time allocation to effectively use time left before July 12

This week I was lucky to find about 6 hours to figure out how to link nodejs app with mongoldb in docker.
To do that I first walked through the introductory tutorials by docker team. Then I just felt that I am not doing what is needed and decided to find a tutorial on how to do that. I found this post: https://medium.com/statuscode/dockerising-a-node-js-and-mongodb-app-d22047e2806f
Although it seemed like ready made solution, app did not reach the db and continued loading. It turned out that instead of localhost in db URL it is required to specify service name.

Here is the raw plan / time allocation:
1. 15-21 June:
    1. intro to K8s - http://rahmonov.me/posts/introduction-to-kubernetes/
    2. complete nodejs + mongoldb in K8s
    3. hello world in serverless framework:
        1. https://serverless.com/
        2. https://kubeless.io/
        3. https://fission.io/
        4. https://nuclio.io/
    4. deploy to Azure
2. 22-28 June - first draft of the presentation:
    1. setup REST api in nodejs that is reading from 2 collections
    2. populate collection with mock data
    3. implement REST api with functions
    4. write a command line client that heavily loads both REST api-s and measures the time
    5. deploy to Azure
    6. prepare the slides
    7. rewrite solution in Java
3. 29 June - 5 July - second draft (be ready by the end of that week):
    1. prepare the code for both endpoints in repository
    2. automate the api load
    3. prepare the slides
4. 6-11 July - 1-2 rehearsals
