# my 1st post

Short post.  
[Yegor](https://www.yegor256.com/) inspired me. Reading the last book by [Dorie Clark](https://www.amazon.de/Entrepreneurial-You-Monetize-Expertise-Multiple/dp/1633692272/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530999076&sr=8-1&keywords=dorie+clark) was the last drop.

It was in two attempts: Web App in Azure and now on Azure Storage [Static Web Site feature](https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/blog/azure-storage-static-web-hosting-public-preview/).

In the first setup the Jekyll and Google Analytics about a month ago.

I setup GDRP popup message to inform the readers.

It is my 5-6 blog. All previous attempts failed. It does not demotivated, though, when I look back at it. This time I want to deliver value to people through content and build a large community of people that benefit from the content.

I am making many mistakes but I am honest and quite open.

The next small step is add newsletter sign-up mechanism and write the next post.
