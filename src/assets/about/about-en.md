#about

This is my no-[bullshit](https://archive.org/details/importanceofwhat00harr/page/117/mode/2up) corner, where you can see ideas I can produce and what thoughts occupy my mind. You may use it when you construct my ["Gamburg's Score"](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%81%D1%87%D1%91%D1%82) in a world full of titles, certifications and degrees.

My name is Farrukh. I am a father, husband and son. I happened to get my bachelor as a software developer. I bring bread home by solving technical problems and by writing code. And I like the way ideas become executable code that later saves time, inspires or makes people more efficient.
